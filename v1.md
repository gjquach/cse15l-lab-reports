I am an 18 year old born and raised in San Francisco, CA. I currently attend University of California, San Diego, 
where I study computer science and compete on the NCAA women's volleyball team. I have two older sisters and a dog named `Bao Bao`. 
My favorite song is *Speak Now by Taylor Swift*, and my favorite movie is *The Pursuit of Happyness*.
