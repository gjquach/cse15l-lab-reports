## About Me

I am an 18 year old born and raised in **San Francisco, CA**. I currently attend *UCSD*, 
where I study computer science and compete on the NCAA DI women's volleyball team (Go Tritons!).  I am passionate about bridging the gender gap in STEM, and ran the San Francisco chapter of [Superposition](https://superposition.tech/) for two years in high school. I recently spent this past summer as an `Technology Support Intern` at the *San Francisco International Airport*. After graduating from *UCSD* in 2024, I hope to work as a software engineer to gain first hand experience in the field before becoming a high school computer science teacher.
